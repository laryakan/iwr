Project Notes "Increased Weapon Ranges" (IWR)
===

In games files, the range is affected by the <bullet> properties / attributes 
its not the weapons but the projectile that affect the range, by it's speed and/or lifetime
Files are located in :
assets/fx/weaponFx/macros/*.xml
and
extensions/*/assets/fx/weaponFx/macros/*.xml

Missiles/torpedos are exceptions, stored in, their range is affected by the engine which trust them
their engine properties are stored in
assets/props/Engines/macros/engine_missile_*_*_macro.xml
which is a better alternative than affect the missile lifetime, because the pilot skill impact on avoidance will be impeded

all these files have been backup in the folder _default in the mod
the May 8th 2025 for DLC Split Vendetta, Cradle of Humanity, Timelines, Kingdom's End and Tides of Avarice (not Hyperion, because I don't have it)

In the base game, at the time (version 7.50, May 8th 2025) there are in 
	01.cat
	05.cat
	07.cat

In the case of DLC
Split Vendetta
	extensions\ego_dlc_split\ext_01.cat
Cradle of Humanity
	extensions\ego_dlc_terran\ext_01.cat
Timelines
	extensions\ego_dlc_timelines\ext_01.cat
Kingdom's End
	extensions\ego_dlc_boron\ext_01.cat
Tides of Avarice
	extensions\ego_dlc_pirate\ext_01.cat
	
All existing weapons of the base game has their range (bullet speed or lifetime in case of beams) increased, in some case their spread has been reduced

Vanilla files have been extracted using XTools_1.11
