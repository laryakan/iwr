INCREASED WEAPON RANGES (IWR) by Laryakan
===

This mod aim to increase weapon ranges (hancrafted/balanced values) for X4: Foundations.
Only Vanilla Weapons are affected, incl. DLC (except Hyperion).

Rules applied by default affects :

<bullet> speed and/or lifetime and or angle (spread), depending of weapons type.

It also affect Missiles/Torpedoes Speed by modifying their engines.

This mod have been develop to be use in cunjuction with mod increasing X4: Foundations default space and ship speed, like XRSGE and REM HYPERDRIVE.
Used with REM INERTIAL MOD, it is a Vanilla alternative to REM OVERHAUL which affect a lot more things than just weapon ranges and ship physics.

You can, of course, use this mod without REM INERTIAL and REM HYPERDRIVE, but combat may become less understable as weapons will be much more deadly.

The mod is delivered with a bash script (usable on linux or bash alternative) capable of applying rules on files located in "_default" folder (by default, only Vanilla ones).
