         description="Increased Weapon Ranges&#13;&#10;Nexus link : https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/1691&#13;&#10;NB: Please note that the Workshop Mod could receive less regular updates than the Nexus Mod&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Increased Weapon Ranges - IWR&#13;&#10;This mod aim to increase weapon ranges (hancrafted/balanced values) for X4: Foundations.&#13;&#10;Only Vanilla Weapons are affected, incl. DLC (except Hyperion).&#13;&#10;It is provided with a generator script which can re-generate assets with the desired factor, angle and speed (only on Nexus in iwr_tools file).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;What it does ?&#13;&#10;It increase weapons ranges !&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Simply download and install the main file. It's packaged, It's smooth, it will work.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;I can only recommends you to use this mod with borther mods which increase space size and speeds like (there are recommendation, not obligation to run Increased Weapons Ranges)&#13;&#10;[XRSGE] : It increase the size of space from 20 to 100, Increased Weapon Ranges takes all its meaning in this mod&#13;&#10;[REM HYPERDRIVE] : To use in addition to XRSGE, It allow you ship to travel at very high speeds&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Flavour&#13;&#10;[REM INERTIAL] : Change the ship physics, it can be a bit clunky, but along side Increased Weapon Ranges, this mod can be a alternative to REM OVERHAUL (see below). Personally, I dont use it anymore because the drift make aiming very hard, AI hardly manage manoeuvers and even Lockboxes drifts while aiming to it :-D&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Alternative&#13;&#10;Alternative mods if you don't like Increased Weapon Ranges mod.&#13;&#10;First, if you want to change value a little bit and know how to execute a bash script, you can try out &quot;generate.sh&quot;.&#13;&#10;If what you're looking for is a mod which go further than range,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- For Vanilla Weapons :&#13;&#10;    - [Simple Combat Overhaul (SCO)﻿﻿] : &#13;&#10;﻿﻿        - This mods is like applying a factor 2 to weapons, but also adjust shield and S ship engines, and so, can't be used with REM HYPERDRIVE&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- If you want a total overhaul of ship equipment which is compatible with XRSGE and REM HYPERDRIVE :&#13;&#10;    - [REM OVERHAUL﻿] :&#13;&#10;﻿﻿        - This is the default choice if you want to play [XRSGE] and [REM HYPERDRIVE], with REM OVERHAUL﻿ you don't need REM INERTIAL MOD&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- And at last but not least, the famous :&#13;&#10;    - [Variety and Rebalance Overhaul (VRO)]﻿ :&#13;&#10;﻿﻿        - This is the most famous weapons and equipment overhaul, but also, it will not be compatible with any mod of the REM Suite&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Technically ?&#13;&#10;- &lt;bullet&gt; speed and/or lifetime and or angle (spread), depending of weapons type.&#13;&#10;- It also affect Missiles/Torpedoes Speed by modifying their engines.&#13;&#10;- Space Suit Laser (Gun and Repair) are excluded because you will not shoot very far in EVA anyway.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This mod have been develop to be use in cunjuction with mod increasing X4: Foundations default space and ship speed, like [XRSGE] and [REM HYPERDRIVE].&#13;&#10;Used with [REM INERTIAL MOD], it is a Vanilla alternative to [REM OVERHAUL] which affect a lot more things than just weapon ranges and ship physics.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;You can, of course, use this mod without [REM INERTIAL] and/or [REM HYPERDRIVE].&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The ./generate.sh script (not in the Steam mod, see iwr_tool on Nexus)&#13;&#10;The mod is delivered with a bash script (usable on linux or bash alternative like powershell on Windows) capable of applying rules on files located in &quot;_default&quot; folder (by default, only Vanilla ones). &#13;&#10;Simply run ./generate.sh and prompt will ask you if you want to reset to default files before applying the factor it will ask you at the next prompt.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Concerning the generate script, where the most effort has been putted into, it has 3 levels of debug verbosity.&#13;&#10;- 0 (no debug) : Will simply generate file without any warning of any sort&#13;&#10;- 1 (&quot;-v&quot;) : Will warn you if values are too high during the application of the intended factor (or adjusted factor)&#13;&#10;- 2 (&quot;-vv&quot;) : all that preceed and it will output old range value vs new range value for each file&#13;&#10;- 3 (&quot;-vvv&quot;) : it's a poke mode only used to debug the code inside the script and not actual value&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The script is able to mitigate your factor to balance weapon a bit more and avoir beam kitting forever.&#13;&#10;It's also able to detected over-valued ranges and under-valued angle. In fact, It can also apply a factor to ranges and another to angles.&#13;&#10;Have a weapons like a shotgun than can shoot far away with the same precision has a railgun isn't really the purpose of this script, but you can try it if you want.&#13;&#10;Anyway, the script will prompt you for everything it needs to generate files in a balanced way, that you can simply ignore and do your thing.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Requirements ?&#13;&#10;- None other than the game&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Redistribution and modification&#13;&#10;BSD 2-Clause License&#13;&#10;Copyright (c) 2025, laryakan&#13;&#10;You are free to use, modify and redistribute any code or assets of mine which is not directly extracted from the game as soon as you mention the above Copyright.&#13;&#10;A link to my github is provided below.
